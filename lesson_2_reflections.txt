What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git is aware of that file and you now have to option to start tracking files within that
repository.
why? because you want to track its versions and changes for some reason.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an in between area for things about to be committed. their not yet in the
repository, and no longer directly connected to working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

use git diff to only add relevant logic changes for committing.
